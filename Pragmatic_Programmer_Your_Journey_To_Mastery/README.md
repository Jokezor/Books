# Notes about the 20th edition


## It’s Your Life

### You Have Agency
Does your work environment suck? Is your job boring? Try to fix it. But don’t try forever. As Martin Fowler says, “you can change your organization or change your organization.”

## The Cat Ate My Source Code

We can be proud of our abilities, but we must own up to our shortcomings—our ignorance and our mistakes.

### Team Trust

Above all, your team needs to be able to trust and rely on you



### Take Responsibility

If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for you, then you should have had a contingency plan. If your mass storage melts—taking all of your source code with it—and you don’t have a backup, it’s your fault. Telling your boss “the cat ate my source code’’ just won’t cut it


### Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses

Think through all of your options before telling someone no. Have options ready and try what you think they will suggest.


## Software Entropy

### Don’t Live with Broken Windows

Don’t leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired.
Neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

### First, Do No Harm

One broken window - a badly designed piece of code, a poor management decision that the team must live with for the duration of the project — is all it takes to start the decline. If you find yourself working on a project with quite a few broken windows, it’s all too easy to slip into the mindset of "All the rest of this code is crap, I’ll just follow suit."

### Challenges

- Help strengthen your team by surveying your project neighborhood. Choose two or three broken windows and discuss with your colleagues what the problems are and what could be done to fix them.

- Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it was the result of someone else’s decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?

It can be hard to notice at first but keeping an eye on the code and thinking ahead makes planning for broken windows easier.
My first reaction is to fix it. I have put other things on hold in order to fix bugs that we have.
You should always fix the windows since it affects everyone in the project. Not only the one who caused it.



## Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs


It’s time to bring out the stones. Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you’ve got it, show people, and let them marvel. Then say "of course, it would be better if we added..." Pretend it’s not important. Sit back and wait for them to start asking you to add the functionality you originally wanted. People find it easier to join an ongoing success. Show them a glimpse of the future and you’ll get them to rally around.

### Be a Catalyst for Change


### Remember the Big Picture

Don’t be like the fabled frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

### Challenges

- While reviewing a draft of the first edition, John Lakos raised the following issue: The soldiers progressively deceive the villagers, but the change they catalyze does them all good. However, by progressively deceiving the frog, you’re doing it harm. Can you determine whether you’re making stone soup or frog soup when you try to catalyze change? Is the decision sub- jective or objective?

By having the bigger picture in mind we will eliminate most errors of stearing in the wrong direction. It's definitely objective. It all depends on what is the end result of the bigger picture.

- Quick, without looking, how many lights are in the ceiling above you? How many exits in the room? How many people? Is there anything out of context, anything that looks like it doesn’t belong? This is an exercise in situational awareness, a technique practiced by folks ranging from Boy and Girl Scouts to Navy SEALs. Get in the habit of really looking and noticing your surroundings. Then do the same for your project.

## Good-Enough Software

The phrase "good enough" does not imply sloppy or poorly produced code. All systems must meet their users' requirements to be successful, and meet basic performance, privacy, and security standards. We are simply advocating that users be given an opportunity to participate in the process of deciding when what you’ve produced is good enough for their needs.

### Involve Your Users in the Trade-Off
